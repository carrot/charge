    <h2>Charge Websockets Example</h2>
    <p>This page demonstrates how you can communicate between the server and the client using charge's websocket capabilities. In the grey box below, you can see the server sending messages to the client every second or so. To send a message from the client to the server, you can hit the button directly below this paragraph. This message will appear in your terminal where you are running the server.</p>
