### Charge Websockets Example

To get started with this example, `cd` into this folder and run:

```
$ node server.js
```

Then open up `localhost:1111` in your browser!

The client-side websocket code can be found in `client.js` and server-side can be found in `server.js`. The rest of the files here are just the glue required to make the example work and look nice.
